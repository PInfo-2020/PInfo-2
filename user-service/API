[Notes]
root="/user"
"Returns" means "sends back a JSON object"
'{something}' is a string parameter. Here they are id's, which MUST BE INTEGERS
  >>example : PUT 'root/{id}/addFridgeitem' ==> PUT '/user/87370952/addFridgeitem'
'(*)' means that an input JSON object is expected
This file may contain deprecated API information. File 'UserRestService.java' contains the actual API code.
As of writing, most of this API functionality is untested.


[GET]
path=root : returns all users
path=root/{id} : returns the user with id '{id}', if it exists


[PUT]
path=root : (*) replaces the existing object (match with id of provided object) with provided object, usually as a means to 'update' it.
path=root/{id}/addFridgeitem : (*) adds provided FridgeItem to the user with id '{id}', if it exists
path=root/{id}/removeFridgeitem/{id2} : removes FridgeItem with id '{id2}' from the user with id '{id}', if it exists
path=root/{id}/replaceFridgeitem/{id2} : (*) replaces FridgeItem with id '{id2}' from the user with id '{id}' with the provided FridgeItem
path=root/{id}/clearFridge : empties the fridge of the user with id '{id}', if it exists
Note : all PUT executions return the modified user if executed correctly
